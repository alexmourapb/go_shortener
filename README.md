Create A URL Shortener With GoLang And MongoDB NoSQL

Continuing down the road of Golang development I thought it would be a cool learning example to develop a URL shortener application similar to that of TinyURL or Bitly.  I think these are great examples because not only does it teach you how to develop a RESTful API that uses a datasource, but it also challenges you to think critically when it comes to the algorithms.
